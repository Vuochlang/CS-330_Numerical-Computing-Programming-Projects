# CS-330-Numerical-Computing

# Project 1 : Computing exp(x)
compute f(x) = e^x = exp(x) using Taylor series. 

# Project 2 : Durand-Kerner method
implement the Durand-Kerner method for finding all n (complex) roots of a nth degree polynomial.

# Project 3 : Implement the algorithm of Trapezoid Rule, Simpson's 1/3 Rule, Simpson's 3/8 Rule and Boole's Rule
implement four numerical methods for approximating definite integrals and use these to estimate the value of Math_PI: By divvying up the interval 
of integration into smaller pieces to obtain more accurate estimates. The output of the program will tabulate the errors between Math_PI and the result from each function.
